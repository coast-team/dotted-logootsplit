- webpack sideeffect prop
- fromPlain
- better pos generation strategy (LSeq)

- Causal context
    - Impelment a custom data structure to store intervals
        - Opretaions:
            - indert(interval)
            - diff(interval)
        - Process for block insertion:
            1. derive the seq interval from delta
            2. diff that
            3. insert diffs in the data structure
            4. use diff to inetrset the block
            5. insert intersection in main structure
        - Process for deletion
            1. derive the seq interval from delta
            2. diff that
            3. insert diffs in the data structure
            4. if diff is not empty then perform the deletion in main structure

- Data repr
    - Decoupling memory and persistent repr
        -> easy tree change
        -> simpler data schema for persistence and communication
    - Persitent repr based on an array of blocks

- Externalized Tree with batched ops
    - Implement an externalized bin tree
        -> better code reuse
        -> better testability
        -> simpler algorithms
        -> simpler code profiling
